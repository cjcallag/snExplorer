Term,Formal Definition,Layman Definition
Actor,"An actor can be a person, organization, gang, etc. An actor is sometimes referred to as a node.","Keep in mind that an actor is not specifically a ""person"". As the definition states, identifying multiple actors (gangs, locations, businesses) help investigators better understand how criminal networks are structured."
Attribute,"Attributes are non-relational characteristics of the individual actors in the network. Examples of attributes of individuals include gender, race, ethnicity, years of education, income level, age, and region/country of birth.",This is one of the harder elements of SNA. LE professionals are oriented to these non relational charateristics. The focus of SNA is first on relationships and we use attributes to better understand social networks.
Average Degree,"Average degree equals the average number of ties among all actors in a network. It is sometimes used an alternative measure to network density because unlike density, it is not sensitive to network size.",The focus of average degree is simply counting the number of ties every actor has in any network and taking the average. This is a good way to determine if actors in a network know everyone else or they are more compartmentalized.
Average Distance,"Average distance refers to the average length of all the shortest paths (i.e., geodesics) between all connected actors in a network and could indicate the speed that information (and other resources) diffuses through a network.","This is a measure of the direct connections between actors in a network. The focus in not how many connections actors in a netwrok have, but how quickly an actor can reach any other actor in a network based on how many other actors they have to go through."
Betweenness Centrality,Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which each actor lies on the shortest path between all other actors in a network.,Imagine that you are a team leader and responsible to coordinate with other team leaders. Betweeness is a measure that looks at how many actors need to go through you to access your team members. This is an important measure to understand who controls the flow of information or who the middle men are who get things done. 
Broker,"An actor that is in a position to broker the flow of material and nonmaterial goods through a network. Analysts have developed numerous algorithms to capture brokerage, including betweenness centrality.","This is based, in part, on betweeness centrality. The actor that can get other actors connected and get things done. Remember that brokers in a netwrok may not realize they are in such a position. We can use this to our advantage and leverge these ""brokers"" as informants."
Centrality,"Centrality measures give a rough indication of the social power of an actor based on their position within the network.  A central actor can be seen as someone who has a lot of ties to other actors (degree centrality), as someone who is closer (in terms of path distance) to all other actors (closeness centrality) than others in the network, as someone who lies on the shortest path (geodesic) between any two actors (betweenness centrality) in a network, or as someone who has ties to actors who are highly central (eigenvector centrality).",Do not rely on only centrality scores as your develop crime reduction stratgies. Keep in mind that there are f
Centralization,"Centralization uses the variation in actor centrality within the network to measure the level of centralization. More variation yields higher network centralization scores; less variation yields lower scores.  In general, the larger a centralization index is, the more likely it is that a single actor is very central while the other actors are not, so they can be seen as measuring how unequal the distribution of individual actor values are. Centralization scores need to be interpreted in light of the type of centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector) being estimated.","This measure should not be confused with Centrality. Centrality is specific to a single actor, while centralization is a measer of the entire network."
Dark Network,"Dark networks are defined as a covert (or clandestine) and illegal networks (Milward and Raab 2006; Raab and Milward 2003) and is a term that (can) include terrorist, criminal and insurgent networks.  The term ÒdarkÓ should not be interpreted normatively. Rather, it is simply a term that seeks to capture the fact that dark networks are those networks that, by definition, try to remain hidden (Tilly 2005).",
Degree Centrality,"Formally, degree centrality of an actor equals the number of lines incident with it. More simply, it is the count of the number of an actorÕs ties. ",
Density,"Conceptually, density refers to the degree to which a network is connected. Formally, it is the number of ties in a simple network, expressed as a proportion of the maximum possible number of ties. It is inversely related to network size (i.e., the larger the network, the lower the density) because the number of possible lines increases exponentially as actors are added to the network, while the number of ties that each actor can maintain tends to be limited. That is why analysts will sometimes turn to other measures, such as average degree, for getting a handle on this dimension of network topography.","The more dense (connected) a netwrok is, the harder it will be to break it up by removing one or two actors."
Diameter,The diameter of a network refers to a network's longest geodesic (see below) and could be interpreted as how spread out a network is.,
Edge,An edge is an undirected tie that connects one actor to another actor. ,"Aka - A relationship. Think friendship, kinship, co-offender…"
Ego-Network,"An ego-network is an actor's (i.e., ego's) immediate social environment: the set of actors to which the actor has ties (i.e., alters, neighbors) and the ties among those actors. There are generally two ways of obtaining ego network data. One way is to use whole network data (see below) and then extract the ego networks of an actor or set of actors. The other is to survey a sample of individuals from whom ego-network data are then collected. Each person surveyed is generally asked for a set of contacts, using questions such as ÒLooking back over the last six months, who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?Ó After providing a list of contacts, they are then asked about the ties (if any) between their contacts (e.g., do they know one another, are they friends, and so on), as well as their contactsÕ various attributes of the alters (e.g., gender, race, education level, etc.).","If you were interested in looking at the interconnectedness of three actors, one approach would be to map out the connections to each actor (ego network) and then join the three networks together to identify common ties. "
Eigenvector Centrality,"Eigenvector centrality assumes that ties to central actors are more important than ties to peripheral actors and thus weights each actorÕs summed connections to others by their (i.e., the others) centrality scores. With an undirected network, eigenvector centrality scores are the same as hubs and authorities scores. ",
Geodesic,A geodesic is the shortest path between two actors.  The longest geodesic in a network is the network's diameter (see diameter),
Global Clustering Coefficient,"The global clustering coefficient equals the sum of each actorÕs clustering coefficient divided by the number of actors in the network. Some software packages only divide by the number of actors with two or more contacts, while others divide by the number of actors in the network. ",This measure will help you see who actors in a network are more likely to know each other based on all of the data that is collected and entered into an SNA software package.
Network Size,The size of a network equals the number of actors in the network.,
Node,"Vertex, actor",
One-mode Network,A one-mode network is a network that consists of a single set of actors. See also two-mode network.,"The example would be looking only at a friednship network. There may be other networks an actor is part of such as kinship, co-offender, etc. "
Tie,A tie is a relation between two actors. A tie can be either directed (arc) or undirected (edge).,"A directed tie indicated a source and a target. For example, if I give you advice, I am the source and you are the target. Investigators can see the direction the advice follows. This is also true for telephone calls, e-mails, text messages, social media communcation and so forth."
Topography,"Network topography refers to the overall structure of the network. Commonly used measures include density, fragmentation, network size, and centralization",
